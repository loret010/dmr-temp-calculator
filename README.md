# DMR Temperature Calculator

A simple web-based tool to estimate the required DMR temperature to reach a target GWh output, based on a steam valve percentage setting. Useful for QSERF and similar Roblox fusion simulations.

🧠 Powered by a real mathematical model derived from game observations.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. You enter the **steam valve percentage** (e.g. 60%, 70%), found at the turbines control panel in Sublevel 2, near electrical.
2. You enter your **target GWh**, found at the Grid Orders panel.
3. It calculates the required **DMR core temperature (Kelvin)** using a quadratic model
